    # Let's re-verify the DisCO paper or common implementations for "average log likelihood"
    # Typically, s_theta(o,q) = log pi_theta(o|q) is sum of log probs of tokens in o.
    # If action_mask is to select tokens, then it should be sum(log_probs[action_mask_is_true]).
    # The previous implementation of DisCOHelper.calculate_scores was:
    # (log_probs * action_mask).sum(dim=-1) / action_mask.sum(dim=-1) for log_l
    # This is average log_prob per token. Let's assume this is the intended behavior for now.
    # If s_theta is sum of log_probs, then the division by action_mask.sum() is not there.
    # Re-reading the DisCO paper: "sθ(o, q) could be the log-likelihood log pθ(o|q)" -> implies sum.

# TODO: Add more tests for edge cases like empty action masks if applicable by design,
# or masks that cover only a few tokens.
# Test with action_mask in DisCOBasicLoss and DisCOLoss to ensure per-token averaging in scores if that's the case.
# The current DisCOHelper.calculate_scores for log_l with action_mask averages log_probs.
# This means the interpretation of s_theta changes.
# If s_theta is sum log p(o|q), then action_mask in helper should just mask, not average.
# For now, tests follow current implementation.
# The current DisCOHelper for `log_l` with an action_mask will compute `(log_probs * action_mask).sum(dim=-1) / action_mask.sum(dim=-1).clamp(min=1)`
# The current DisCOHelper for `l_ratio` with an action_mask will compute `(log_probs * mask).sum(dim=-1) - (old_log_probs * mask).sum(dim=-1)` (assuming mask.sum is not used for division here based on code structure for l_ratio)
